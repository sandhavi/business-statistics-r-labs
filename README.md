## Data

Each lab exercise uses specific datasets such as `mtcars`, `Class`, `airquality`, `iris`, `cats`, and custom datasets provided in the lab instructions.

## How to Use

1. **Install R**: Make sure R is installed on your machine. You can download it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. **Run the Scripts**: Use RStudio or any R environment to execute the scripts provided for each lab exercise.
3. **View Outputs**: The outputs include various charts, tables, and statistical analyses that answer the lab questions.
